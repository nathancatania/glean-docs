Workspace Settings, also known as the Admin UI, is a central hub within Glean that allows admins to manage and configure their deployment. It is designed to be user-friendly and self-served, empowering customer admins to set up their deployment without needing a dedicated project.

## Key Features
* **Role Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admins can manage what permissions teammates have via the Teammates page of Workspace Settings. They can grant a user permission to moderate content, or relevate them to either Full Admin or Setup Admin roles.

* **Authentication Settings:** Admins can configure which Identity Provider (IdP) is configured for Single Sign-On (SSO).

* **Search Management:** Admins can check whether a user has access to a document within Glean, or hide documents from appearing in search results.

* **Datasource Management:** Admins can manage and configure the datasources that Glean can access. This includes adding new datasources, removing existing ones, and adjusting the permissions and access levels.

* **Glean Assistant Setup:** Admins can set up Glean Assistant, which covers Generative AI features such as chat, answers, and summarization.

* **Manage Adoption**: Admins can track the people in their company who haven't yet been invited to Glean, who have received an invite, and who are actively using Glean - all in a single view.
