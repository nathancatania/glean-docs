# Accessing the Admin User Interface

## Accessing the Glean App

Glean is a powerful knowledge management tool designed to streamline your workspace by making information easily accessible. It allows you to search across various data sources, share knowledge with your team, and leverage advanced features for complex workflows.

To access the Glean app, navigate to `app.glean.com` in your web browser. If you're not already logged in, you'll be prompted to do so. Enter your credentials to log in.

The Glean app is where you and your team can search, share, and manage knowledge across your organization. It's designed to help you find the information you need quickly and efficiently, without having to switch between multiple applications or search through endless files and folders.

## The Admin Interface

As an administrator, you also have access to the Glean Admin User Interface (Admin UI). This is where you'll manage your Glean workspace, including setting up Single Sign-On (SSO), configuring data sources, and syncing people data.

To access the Admin UI, navigate to app.glean.com/admin in your web browser. If you're not already logged in, you'll be prompted to do so. Enter your administrator credentials to log in.

Remember, as an administrator, you have the privilege to add, modify, and delete users, groups, privileges, and facilities. All your activities will be logged for security and auditing purposes.
