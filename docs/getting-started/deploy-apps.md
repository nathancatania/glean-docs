## About the Glean Browser Extension & Apps
By default, a user must access Glean by explicitly typing `https://app.glean.com` into their browser, or by clicking the Glean tile in your company's SSO App Library. Both of these options have significant friction to them, and on their own, lead to poor adoption of Glean.

The best way to drive Glean adoption at your company is by deploying the browser extension and apps to their corporate devices.
