Content restrictions in Glean are a powerful tool for managing the visibility and accessibility of your organization's data. Two key methods for applying these restrictions are greenlisting and redlisting.

## What are Greenlisting and Redlisting?
**Greenlisting** is the process of specifying which data sources or items should be included in Glean's search results. Only the items on the greenlist will be crawled and indexed, making them searchable in Glean.

**Redlisting**, on the other hand, is the process of specifying which data sources or items should be excluded from Glean's search results. Items on the redlist will not be crawled or indexed, and therefore, will not appear in Glean's search results.

## Why are they Important?
Greenlisting and redlisting are crucial for managing data visibility and ensuring that only relevant and approved content is accessible through Glean's search. This can be particularly useful in situations where certain data is sensitive or irrelevant to certain users or groups within your organization.

## How to Apply Greenlisting and Redlisting?
The process of applying greenlisting and redlisting involves specifying the data sources or items to be included or excluded. This can be done through the Glean Admin UI, or via Glean support.

For greenlisting, you would provide a list of data sources or items that should be included in the search results. For redlisting, you would provide a list of data sources or items that should be excluded from the search results.

For information on what restrictions each connector supports, see the **Restricting Content** page for the required connector.
