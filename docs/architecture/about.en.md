Glean provides a universal enterprise search tool that allows users to search their data scattered across multiple applications (e.g. Gdrive, Slack, Confluence, Jira, Box, Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.) from a single interface.

The product can be accessed from a web app or via a Browser extension that brings the search experience to the new tab page as well as in a sidebar that can be opened while on any web page.

The key use cases for different business units and teams can be summarized as below:

* Support - Current users are able to close tickets faster by finding the most relevant information, whether it's in a CRM Knowledge Base article, a JIRA ticket, or a GDrive doc they never knew about.
* Sales - Pre-Sales Engineers and Account Execs are able to find relevant information for customer questions whether it's in a GDrive doc, a presentation in the LMS, or anywhere else.
* Engineering - Search across common engineering tools like JIRA, Slack, and Confluence makes it easy to find anything, instantly.

These are specific examples, but the tool is built in such a way that it can be used by anyone in the company.
