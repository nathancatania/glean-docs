It serves as a real-time model of an enterprise's indexed information, built upon three pillars: Content (assets, documents, messages, etc), People (identities, roles, permissions), Activity (The creation date and edit/view/sharing history for all Content). The Knowledge Graph's understanding of these elements and their interrelationships enables Glean to deliver highly relevant search results. It also adapts and improves over time as it accumulates more content, context, and user activity data. This self-tuning capability, combined with the Knowledge Graph, allows Glean to understand the context and relationship between the employees in an organization and the work they do, enhancing the search experience. |
