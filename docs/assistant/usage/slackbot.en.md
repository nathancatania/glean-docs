If your organization uses Slack, you can configure Glean Assistant as a bot within your Slack workspace to automatically answer questions as employees post them.

The answers Glean Assistant provides are only visible to the employee who posted the message unless shared more broadly by them.

!!! info
    Glean Assistant will only be invoked if it has reasonable confidence that it can provide an accurate answer.
