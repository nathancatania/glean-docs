**AI Answers** are typically used in the context of search results, providing direct answers to user queries based on the content of your documents.

They are permissions enforced and provide references to where information is coming from. AI Answers are designed to minimize the extent of hallucination by grounding the generation on the content of your documents and providing citations. They are also deterministic, meaning they are consistent from run to run.
