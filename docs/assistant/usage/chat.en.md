Glean Chat allows users to ask questions like they would a colleague (in a similar interface to ChatGPT), harnessing your company's knowledge in a way that's completely personalized to each user.

It is designed to generate a high-confidence response using the permission set of the person who posted the question, and will provide citations in its response to ensure the answers it provides can be trusted.
