The AI Summarization feature of Glean Assistant provides concise summaries of documents and message chains. This feature is designed to enhance your productivity by providing a quick overview of a document's content without having to read the entire document.

To summarize a document, hover over a search result and click the **Summarize** button that appears at the top-right of the result.

Glean Assistant will then summarize the contents of the document, with the user being able to ask follow-up questions regarding the document contents.
