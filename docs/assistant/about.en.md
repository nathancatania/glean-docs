Glean Assistant is designed to enhance your workplace experience by providing you with the information you need, when you need it, in a secure and personalized manner. It understands your company's content, internal language, people, and relationships, enabling Glean Assistant to deliver more relevant and accurate information than publicly available generative AI tools.
