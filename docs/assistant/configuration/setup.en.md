!!! info
    If you have just set up your Glean tenant, before proceeding with this step, you should ensure that all of your initial datasource crawls have finished. This will enhance the quality of Glean Assistant's responses.

!!! warning "License required"
    You must be licensed for Glean Assistant in order to activate and use it.

## Activate Glean Assistant
Glean Assistant is currently in Early Access, and you must have a valid license for Assistant to continue. You can activate your access by navigating to [Workspace Settings > Setup > Assistant](https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/gleanassistant){:target="_blank"} and selecting **Activate**.

??? Danger "Is Assistant greyed out or disabled?"
    If the **Assistant** option under Workspace Settings > Setup is greyed out, this means that:

    1. Your People Data sync has not been started, OR
    2. Glean Assistant is not available for activation at this time.
    
    Please contact Glean Support for further assistance.

## Assign Users
Glean Assistant can be enabled for the entire organization or for a selected test group of users. Glean recommends enabling Assistant for a test group first before proceeding with the rollout to the broader organization.

In the [Setup](https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/gleanassistant?tab=setup) tab under the [settings for Glean Assistant](https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/gleanassistant?tab=setup), click to open the **Early access users** dropdown and select either:

* Enabled for all teammates
* Enabled for test group only

Select **Enabled for test group only** and click the **Add teammates** button to specify the users who will have access to Glean Assistant.


## Enable Glean Assistant

Once you have specified the users that Assistant should be enabled for, click the **Enable Glean Assistant**, button to turn on Assistant for those users.

Alternatively, you can also follow any of the applicable optional steps below to customize Assistant and its behavior.
