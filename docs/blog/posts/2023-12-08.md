## Go Links

* Go Links Permissions
    * This latest feature enhances the control that admins have over new Go Links default permissions, promoting a more secure editing environment. Admins now have the option to limit Go Links editing access to only admins and owners by default. However, flexibility is still key, so the creator of a Go Link can also choose to grant editing access to anyone by simply deselecting the “Restrict edit access” option on the Go Link itself when needed.
